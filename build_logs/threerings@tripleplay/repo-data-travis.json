Track any resolved style or ephemeral data which is needed to layout a\nwidget. This stuff is only needed for layout, so we'd resolve it, compute\npreferred size, do the layout, then throw it away. That way we're not keeping\naround a bunch of crap for every single widget during normal operation.\n\n2. Use the resolved data to compute widget's preferred size, via\nLayoutData.computeSize().\n\n3. Use the resolved data to lay the widget out, via LayoutData.layout().\n\nBut this sucked when you just wanted to make a minor tweak to computeSize() or\nlayout() based on some non-ephemeral state. You had to create a special\nsubclass of LayoutData just to hold the code that really should have been in\nthe Element subclass instead.\n\nThere was also some fiddly shenanigans with BaseLayoutData and LayoutData for\nprobably stupid reasons that have long since been forgotten.\n\nNow there's just one LayoutData class, which defines two (\"NOOP\" by default)\nmethods: computeSize() and layout(), and two Element methods (of the same name)\nwhich delegate to the LayoutData methods by default.\n\nIn cases where a simple tweak is needed (Box, Composite, GlyphWidget,\nImageButton), no custom LayoutData class is needed at all. The Element\nsubclasses just override the methods that would have delegated to LayoutData\nand do the right thing right there. Simple!\n\nIn one case (Scroller), ScrollerLayoutData is used to track some ephemeral\ndata, but we still handle the computeSize() and layout() in Scroller's methods\nrather than ScrollerLayoutData's methods (mainly because we're specializing\nComposite/Container, which now do their layout in Element.layout).\n\nIn a few other cases (TextWigdet, Slider), we still do things the \"old\" way,\nwhere TextWidgetLayoutData and SliderLayoutData implement computeSize() and\nlayout() directly, because they resolve a shit ton of layout data and it's nice\nto be able to access that stuff directly via the this pointer.\n\nI was tempted to convert everything to \"Scroller\"-style where all LayoutData\nsubclasses were just structs that held extra data and all custom logic went\ninto the Element subclass, but I needed to preserve the old LayoutData methods\nand behavior for all the custom code out in the wild that has created its own\nLayoutData subclass. So since that has to live on, I might as well use it in\nthe few cases where it's tidier.","duration":109,"started_at":"2015-07-14T17:37:37Z","jobs":[70942842],"event_type":"push","author_email":"mdb@samskivert.com","committer_email":"mdb@samskivert.com"},{"build_id":70446183,"commit":"25225ac98c0b3a9d62be0f4e9edaeb2bd58c321f","pull_req":null,"branch":"master","status":"errored","message":"Send modifier info with events.","duration":63,"started_at":"2015-07-10T20:54:05Z","jobs":[70446184],"event_type":"push","author_email":"mdb@samskivert.com","committer_email":"mdb@samskivert.com"},{"build_id":68842076,"commit":"40a2cd9bbd7d6d81a6fa378e087b9f8ff1e3b33d","pull_req":null,"branch":"master","status":"passed","message":"Pruned unused imports.","duration":112,"started_at":"2015-06-29T17:15:40Z","jobs":[68842081],"event_type":"push","author_email":"mdb@samskivert.com","committer_email":"mdb@samskivert.com"},{"build_id":68731463,"commit":"16d767794e13ba43950b5442361e41cf750e444b","pull_req":null,"branch":"master","status":"passed","message":"Only add rowgap if rowHeight > 0.\n\nPreviously even if all elements in a row were non-visible, an unnecessary\nrowgap was still being inserted.","duration":117,"started_at":"2015-06-28T21:44:18Z","jobs":[68731464],"event_type":"push","author_email":"mdb@samskivert.com","committer_email":"mdb@samskivert.com"},{"build_id":68730613,"commit":"48efffdb74e5b01cddd79fdf51f4030e464b71dd","pull_req":null,"branch":"master","status":"passed","message":"Fail fast.","duration":110,"started_at":"2015-06-28T21:34:40Z","jobs":[68730614],"event_type":"push","author_email":"mdb@samskivert.com","committer_email":"mdb@samskivert.com"},{"build_id":67909192,"commit":"352adc80c65e6ccf4e681e1310f0bcd1ee746192","pull_req":null,"branch":"master","status":"passed","message":"Added varlong to Inflater/Deflater.","duration":120,"started_at":"2015-06-22T21:31:04Z","jobs":[67909193],"event_type":"push","author_email":"mdb@samskivert.com","committer_email":"mdb@samskivert.com"},{"build_id":67907061,"commit":"11aa68ecd346e123d9604535e257ae921581eb39","pull_req":null,"branch":"master","status":"passed","message":"Added doc comment, clarification re: who uses what.","duration":140,"started_at":"2015-06-22T21:21:24Z","jobs":[67907062],"event_type":"push","author_email":"mdb@samskivert.com","committer_email":"mdb@samskivert.com"},{"build_id":67906814,"commit":"ea97b6d9e47b55eab65c083718816b89867042c5","pull_req":null,"branch":"master","status":"passed","message":"Fixed indent.","duration":160,"started_at":"2015-06-22T21:11:45Z","jobs":[67906815],"event_type":"push","author_email":"mdb@samskivert.com","committer_email":"mdb@samskivert.com"},{"build_id":66263609,"commit":"04f6a916a0f369c29cc5a501a97f39420cc98cb1","pull_req":null,"branch":"master","status":"errored","message":"Added some toStrings for debuggery.","duration":30,"started_at":"2015-06-10T18:37:40Z","jobs":[66263610],"event_type":"push","author_email":"mdb@samskivert.com","committer_email":"mdb@samskivert.com"},{"build_id":66150689,"commit":"6580d7a0e2fda773c3a7e0f4f1bbde051cc8ef60","pull_req":null,"branch":"master","status":"errored","message":"Beans/frank.","duration":20,"started_at":"2015-06-10T02:40:38Z","jobs":[66150690],"event_type":"push","author_email":"mdb@samskivert.com","committer_email":"mdb@samskivert.com"},{"build_id":66139499,"commit":"372382d25d503e4906bbb1509dcf50bdc2e4c2c6","pull_req":null,"branch":"master","status":"errored","message":"Element can now track bindings to reactive values.\n\nThis allows the element to establish a connection when it is added to a UI\nhierarchy and dispose of it when it is removed.

A ScreenSpace provides an infinite 2D grid metaphor, where new\nscreens slide in from a direction, and the user then goes \"back\" by sliding the\ncurrent screen back in the direction from whence it came.\n\nCare has been taken to allow a ScreenSpace to interact comfortably with screens\nthat scroll (via Flicker). So you can, for example, scroll a new screen UP into\nview, then then allow the user to continue scrolling up to see the whole\nscrolled screen. But if they scroll DOWN while looking at the top of the\nscreen, this initiates an untransition gesture which takes them back to the\nprevious screen.\n\nNaturally when you transition screens orthogonally to the main scroll direction\n(slide new screen in LEFT and then scroll up and down), things work nicely as\nwell.\n\nThis is not yet totally complete. There are some non-space transitions to be\nimplemented (IN/OUT which will zoom and cross fade to simulate going INto our\nOUT of the plane, and FLIP, which will work like ScreenStack's flip). These\nnon-space transitions will not afford user initiated untransition gestures, so\nin those cases the app will have to provide back buttons, as usual. But it's\nnice to have the option to include non-spatial transitions where they make\nsense.\n\nI'm also going to support a horizontally scrolled, but snapped to contents,\nstyle UI screen where the screen supports an arbitrary number of UI Roots each\nof which is laid out vertically, and the user can use sliding gestures to go\nleft and right between them. Naturally, this will be set up so that if you want\nyou can have a leftward slide from the left-most column initiate an\nuntransition to the previous screen if that's how these screens came in, or you\ncan transition vertically into a left/right navigable screen, and have the user\ngo UP to get out of it (which is nice because they can use UP regardless of\nwhich column they're in).","duration":188,"started_at":"2014-12-26T22:16:39Z","jobs":[45180034],"event_type":"push","author_email":"mdb@samskivert.com","committer_email":"mdb@samskivert.com"},{"build_id":44876928,"commit":"ac7247e01eb99f5fbcc2fcf9794f9aaad1ab91b6","pull_req":null,"branch":"master","status":"passed","message":"More Guava removal.","duration":193,"started_at":"2014-12-22T22:03:50Z","jobs":[44876929],"event_type":"push","author_email":"mdb@samskivert.com","committer_email":"mdb@samskivert.com"},{"build_id":44874649,"commit":"0040528a54a5236caa81c99805be18c27553401d","pull_req":null,"branch":"master","status":"errored","message":"Omit use of Guava.\n\nplayn-java no longer provides it.

AnimGroup was checking canceled, but Animation wasn't. The\nduplication is now gone and the logic is necessarily consistent because it only\nexists once.\n\nI changed the canceled check to cause things to blow up. Either you cancel()\nyour animations or you complete() them. You don't mix and match. There's no way\nwe can do anything reasonable in such circumstances, so we disallow it.\n\nThe makeComplete() (nee complete()) method is now documented as being\nidempotent so that we can now simply go through the whole animation chain and\nmark every animation is complete whether or not it has been previously\nprocessed.\n\nIf a layer is in an animation chain multiple times, like:\n\n  moveTo(layerA, pointA).then.moveTo(layerA, pointB)\n\nand the first animation has already completed before complete() is called, then\nthe first animation will move layerA to pointA during the completion process,\nbut the second animation will move layerA to pointB immediately afterwards, so\naside from a miniscule amount of extra effort (possibly offset by vastly\nsimpler completion logic) there will be no visible funny business. Everything\nwill end up where it should be were the animation chain allowed to complete\nnormally.\n\nIt is possible that a totally separate animation chain was queued up to\nmanipulate a layer after the first one completed, but then that first one went\non to do other things and was complete()d later, thereby stepping on the toes\nof the second spawned animation chain. But arguably you should be completing\nall animation chains in that case and completing them in the order that they\nwere spawned, so you should still be OK. Though you really shouldn't be doing\nsuch crazy shit in the first place.\n\nI also removed Repeat _isCompleted tracking because it didn't make any sense.\nAt first I thought animation chains were intended to be reused, but that's not\npossible. complete() also cancel()s the animations, and once an animation is\ncancel()ed, it can never be reused. Moreover, once an animation is cancel()ed,\nnext() will never be called on it.

But at that point, maybe you should just\nbe calling paint() with your calculated dt yourself. I haven't fully thought\nit through, so that's left as an excercise for the reader when he or she\ndecides to go into wacky town like that.","duration":158,"started_at":"2014-02-04T22:00:09Z","jobs":[18230873],"event_type":"push","author_email":"karma@deadmoose.com","committer_email":"karma@deadmoose.com"},{"build_id":18146672,"commit":"5042539699b53b0540a0b5e7679e1f91d2d0b072","pull_req":null,"branch":"master","status":"passed","message":"Speeling","duration":160,"started_at":"2014-02-03T18:37:00Z","jobs":[18146673],"event_type":"push","author_email":"karma@deadmoose.com","committer_email":"karma@deadmoose.com"},{"build_id":18086265,"commit":"6f2addf85ade3ee659ffd5f28df77f386a28d7c5","pull_req":null,"branch":"master","status":"passed","message":"Put
